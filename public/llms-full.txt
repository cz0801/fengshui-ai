# About aifengshui.app

> aifengshui.app is an AI-powered Feng Shui platform that allows users to upload their room or floor plan to receive instant analysis based on classical Feng Shui principles. Designed for home owners, designers, and spiritual wellness seekers, the tool provides easy-to-understand suggestions on Qi flow, elemental balance, and layout improvements.

## Website Background

Our vision is to help more people benefit from Feng Shui regardless of their cultural background or geographic location. The platform uses natural language processing, image recognition, and Five Element theory to generate insights and personalized recommendations.
