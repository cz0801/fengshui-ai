          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Headboard against a solid wall, for stability and support:</strong>
              <p>
                The bed should be placed with the headboard firmly against a solid wall. This symbolizes having a reliable “backing” or support (“靠山”) in life, which promotes a sense of safety during sleep and supports career and personal development. Avoid positioning the bed with a window directly behind the headboard, as windows cannot provide stable support and may introduce disruptive airflow that disturbs sleep. If placing the bed against a wall is impossible, at least ensure the bed has a sturdy headboard to prevent the sensation of the head being “unsupported.” Additionally, the wall behind the bed should not directly adjoin a bathroom or kitchen, as these spaces carry water and fire energies that may interfere with rest.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Avoid having the bed directly facing the bedroom door:</strong>
              <p>
                Feng Shui emphasizes that “the bed should not face the door directly.” If the bed faces the door, it compromises privacy and security, and the direct energy flow from the doorway can disrupt rest and health. This layout is considered highly inauspicious, leading to restlessness and poor sleep. If the room layout forces the bed to face the door, consider adjusting the bed’s angle or placing a screen or curtain between the bed and the door. This not only blocks the clashing energy but also preserves the room’s intimacy and tranquility. Ideally, avoid situations where the head or foot of the bed directly aligns with the door.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Bed position should allow visibility of doors and windows:</strong>
              <p>
                Ideally, when lying in bed, one should be able to see the bedroom door and windows. This follows the Feng Shui principle of “seeing the entrance promotes peace of mind.” Being aware of who may enter the room fosters a sense of control and calmness. Additionally, allowing morning sunlight to reach the bed enhances Yang energy, promoting vitality. However, the bed should not lie in the direct path between the door and the window, as this creates a “Qi corridor” that may disturb sleep with its strong energy flow.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Choose a headboard direction aligned with Earth’s magnetic field:</strong>
              <p>
                The direction of the bed’s headboard can influence sleep quality and health. Traditional Feng Shui recommends a north-south alignment—sleeping with your head pointing either north or south. This orientation harmonizes with the Earth’s magnetic field and is believed to support blood circulation and restful sleep. Scientific studies suggest that aligning the body with magnetic north-south lines helps improve sleep quality. In contrast, placing the headboard toward the west is considered undesirable due to the Earth’s rotation from west to east, which may lead to restless sleep and fatigue. Therefore, avoid headboard orientations facing east or west when possible.
              </p>

            <li>
              <strong>Avoid overhead pressure—no beams or heavy objects above the bed:</strong>
              <p>
                It is crucial to avoid placing the bed directly under exposed beams or large overhanging structures. This is known in Feng Shui as “beam pressing down” and is seen as harmful to health. Sleeping under such pressure may lead to issues like headaches and poor sleep quality. If structural beams are unavoidable, consider covering them with ceiling design elements (e.g., false ceiling) or moving the bed to a safer location. Similarly, avoid placing large objects such as ceiling-mounted air conditioners, overhead cabinets, or heavy chandeliers directly above the bed, as they can create subconscious stress and negative energy.

          <h2 id="mirror-door-and-window-taboos-in-bedroom-feng-shui">Mirror, Door, and Window Taboos in Bedroom Feng Shui</h2>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Avoid mirrors facing the bed:</strong>
              <p>
                One of the most well-known Feng Shui taboos is placing a mirror directly opposite the bed. Mirrors reflect both energy and light, and are considered Yin elements in Feng Shui. When people are in a semi-conscious state during the night, seeing their own reflection can cause subconscious fear, leading to restlessness and poor sleep. Mirrors can also reflect negative energy (Sha Qi), and if placed facing the bed, they may bounce this energy back toward the sleeper—disrupting health, luck, and relationships. This is especially harmful at night when Yang energy is weak and Yin energy prevails, which may cause the body’s Yang Qi to dissipate and attract negative influences.
              </p>
              <p>
                Therefore, dressing mirrors, wardrobe mirrors, or any reflective surfaces should not face the bed directly. If space constraints make it impossible to move the mirror, it’s advisable to cover it with a cloth at night or turn it toward the wall. A smart modern solution is to install mirrors on the inside of closet doors—allowing them to be used only when needed and kept hidden otherwise. The key principle: never allow your bed to be directly reflected in a mirror, as this can negatively impact both sleep quality and emotional harmony.
              </p>

              />
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Avoid door clashes and “door-to-door” alignments:</strong>
              <p>
                In Feng Shui, the orientation of the bedroom door is crucial. First, the bedroom door should not directly face the main entrance. The front door is a high-traffic area that brings in active energy, noise, and outside air, which can invade the quiet energy of the bedroom and reduce privacy. From a Feng Shui perspective, this forms a clash known as “door confrontation” (相骂门), which can cause tension and arguments among family members.
              </p>
              <p>
                Secondly, the bedroom door should not face the bathroom door. Bathrooms generate dampness and negative energy; if aligned with the bedroom, these undesirable elements can flow directly into the sleeping space, harming health over time.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thirdly, avoid placing the bedroom door opposite the kitchen door or too close to the kitchen. Kitchens are fiery areas associated with heat and smoke. Having the bedroom directly face or share a wall with the kitchen may allow fire energy and cooking fumes to disturb the bedroom’s calmness. This can lead to irritability and poor concentration. Particularly harmful is placing the bed’s headboard against the wall shared with the kitchen stove, as constant exposure to cooking heat is detrimental to health.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lastly, do not place the bedroom door directly opposite another bedroom door. This “door-to-door” configuration can cause interpersonal friction, especially among family members, leading to constant conflict. To neutralize the negative energy from such arrangements, you can hang a curtain, bead string, or a set of Five Emperor Coins (五帝钱) on the doors. Keeping the doors closed as much as possible is also recommended to minimize the energy clash.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Avoid placing the bed too close to or under a window:</strong>
              <p>
                Windows are portals for light, air, and energy. Placing a bed directly under or against a window is considered unfavorable in Feng Shui. Such arrangements lack the symbolic and literal support of a solid wall, making sleepers feel insecure. Additionally, strong wind, light glare, or external disturbances like street noise can disrupt rest and create what is known as “window Sha”—sharp energy that interferes with the accumulation of positive Qi.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over time, this can result in tension, poor sleep, and weakened health. If the bed must be placed near or opposite a window and cannot be moved, consider installing thick blackout curtains to block light and airflow during sleep. Always aim to position the bed away from direct window alignment and ensure the headboard is not floating beneath an uncovered window, as this lacks grounding and stability in both Feng Shui and psychological terms.

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Choose soft and calming overall tones:</strong>
              <p>
                In Feng Shui, there’s a guiding principle: “Bright living room, dim bedroom” (明厅暗房). This doesn’t mean the bedroom should be poorly lit, but rather that its color scheme should promote relaxation through soft and soothing tones. Overly bright, vibrant, or dark colors can negatively influence emotional well-being and sleep quality.
              </p>
              <p>
                It’s best to avoid using intense or deeply saturated colors across large wall areas. Instead, opt for light, neutral, and calming tones such as ivory, cream, beige, pale yellow, light gray, or nature-inspired hues like soft green and gentle blue. These colors create a peaceful, cozy atmosphere that helps calm the mind and support restful sleep. In contrast, overly bright or chaotic color schemes can disrupt the energy flow in the bedroom and affect rest.
              </p>
            </li>

            <BlogImage
              src="/blog/bedroom-fengshui-guide-part1/calming-bedroom-colors.png"
              alt="Soft and calming bedroom color palette such as ivory, beige, light blue"
              width={1200}
              height={630}
            />

            <li>
              <strong>Colors to avoid and their reasons:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Bright red or deep purple:</strong>
                  <p>
                    These bold colors belong to the Fire element and are highly stimulating. Using large areas of red or purple in the bedroom can overexcite the nervous system, making it hard to relax and potentially causing irritability, conflict, or emotional outbursts. For those who love these hues, it’s better to use them as small accents—such as pillows, picture frames, or vases—balanced with cool tones like white, gray, or blue to soften their impact.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Black or excessively dark colors:</strong>
                  <p>
                    Black is considered a heavy Yin color in Feng Shui and symbolizes gloom, depression, or even death. Overuse of black or very dark tones can lead to an excess of Yin energy, resulting in negative emotions, lethargy, or poor sleep. Such darkness can also make the space feel unsafe or induce nightmares. If you favor darker tones, use them sparingly and balance them with lighter colors like white, cream, or soft yellow to bring warmth and light into the space.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Overuse of pink:</strong>
                  <p>
                    While pink is often associated with romance and sweetness, in Feng Shui it’s considered a Yin color with unstable energy. Excessive use of pink—especially in bedrooms—can attract problematic romantic energy (so-called “rotten peach blossoms”), drawing in insincere partners or causing third-party interference. It may also heighten emotional sensitivity, increasing tension between couples. Married couples should avoid using pink excessively throughout the room. If desired, use it modestly in bedding or curtains and pair it with grounding colors like warm tones or gold accents to restore balance.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Too many colors or chaotic combinations:</strong>
                  <p>
                    While some people enjoy colorful, eclectic bedroom designs, too many clashing colors in Feng Shui can lead to energy confusion. Different colors have different elemental associations, and when combined excessively, they can disrupt the room’s energy balance and make relaxation difficult. Ideally, a bedroom should feature no more than three dominant colors. For variety, follow the “1-2-3” rule: one primary color, one accent color, and one neutral or transitional tone, in a general 6:3:1 ratio. This ensures visual depth without overwhelming the senses.
                  </p>
                </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Choosing bedroom decorations wisely:</strong>
              <p>
                Decorations in the bedroom should foster peace, warmth, and auspicious symbolism. Choose artwork that conveys positive meanings—landscapes, flowers, birds, or traditional symbols of joy and abundance. For instance, peony paintings symbolize wealth and harmony and are great for promoting marital bliss. Images of paired animals like mandarin ducks or lovebirds represent deep romantic bonds and are well-suited for the master bedroom.
              </p>
              <p>
                Avoid art with negative or melancholic themes—such as lonely sunsets, withered trees, or dying flowers—as these can subconsciously evoke sadness or pessimism, potentially affecting emotional health. Similarly, portraits or images of sad or solitary figures (e.g., someone staring into the distance or crying) may bring a sense of isolation to the room’s energy.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Feng Shui details in décor:</strong>
              <p>
                Follow the principle of “less is more” when decorating a bedroom. Keep decorations meaningful but minimal to avoid visual clutter. Hanging a family photo above the bed can enhance familial harmony and emotional bonding. Placing paired figurines (like lovebirds or magpies) can boost romantic energy and joyful vibes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Avoid displaying weapons, eerie masks, or decor with aggressive or disturbing symbolism, as these can create anxiety and disrupt emotional balance. Married couples should steer clear of anything that symbolizes a third party—for example, avoid placing photos of ex-partners, solo wedding portraits of someone else, or figurines of lone individuals on bedside tables.
              </p>
              <p>
                Also, avoid placing heavy or oversized artwork above the bed, as it may cause a feeling of pressure or psychological discomfort. In Feng Shui, this is called “beam suppression” (横梁煞), and it is believed to negatively affect both sleep quality and personal safety. Opt instead for lightweight, uplifting pieces that complement the calming energy of the space.
