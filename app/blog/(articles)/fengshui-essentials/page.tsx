          <h2 id="feng-shui-mirrors" className='scroll-mt-24'>4. Feng Shui Mirrors: Reflecting Positive Energy</h2>
          <p>Mirrors are a double-edged sword in Feng Shui, as they can reflect energy in both positive and negative ways depending on where they are placed. In the bedroom, mirrors should be placed carefully to avoid reflecting negative energy or disrupting your sleep. Avoid placing mirrors directly across from the bed, as this can cause restlessness and disturb sleep.</p>
          <p>Instead, mirrors can be placed strategically to reflect positive energy, such as a beautiful view or a source of natural light. This helps in expanding the positive energy and creating a serene atmosphere in your bedroom.</p>
          <p>For a more precise guide on how to position mirrors in your bedroom, try using the <a href="https://www.aifengshui.app/bedroom-layout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>AI Bedroom Feng Shui Analysis</strong></a> tool.

          <h2 id="feng-shui-bed-positioning" className='scroll-mt-24'>5. Feng Shui Bed Positioning: The Foundation of Restful Sleep</h2>
          <p>In Feng Shui, the bed is the most important piece of furniture in the bedroom because it directly affects your health and well-being. Proper bed positioning is crucial for ensuring restful sleep and a balanced environment. Here are the key principles for placing your bed:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Place the bed in the command position</strong>: The ideal position is one where you can see the door without being directly in line with it. This position gives you a sense of control and safety.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid placing the bed under a window</strong>: This can cause restless sleep due to the energy flowing freely in and out of the room.</li>
            <li><strong>Keep the bed away from electrical devices</strong>: Try to keep your bed as far from electronics as possible to avoid interference with your sleep energy.</li>
          </ul>
