            1. Choose a Square or Rectangular Bedroom Shape
          </h2>

          <p className="mb-4">
            In Feng Shui, symmetry and stability are crucial for restful energy flow. Irregular or angular-shaped bedrooms, such as those with slanted walls or sharp corners, can create visual confusion and psychological stress. These shapes distort the natural energy flow and may cause mental fatigue, anxiety, or even illness over time.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            A rectangular or square layout offers a sense of completeness and containment‚Äîperfect for a sanctuary like the bedroom.

            2. Maintain Brightness During the Day and Dimness at Night
          </h2>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Your bedroom should support your body‚Äôs circadian rhythm. During the daytime, allow as much natural light in as possible. Sunlight uplifts energy and improves mood. Make sure your bedroom has windows and proper ventilation.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            At night, use curtains or blackout blinds to block external light sources, promoting deeper, uninterrupted sleep. Harsh light exposure at night can affect melatonin production and lead to restlessness.
          </p>

            3. Avoid Converting Bathrooms into Bedrooms
          </h2>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Bathrooms are considered spaces of drainage and waste. In modern high-rise buildings, bathroom plumbing is vertically aligned across floors. Converting a bathroom into a bedroom can result in sleeping between two wet and polluted spaces, especially if the upstairs and downstairs still serve as bathrooms.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            This not only brings excessive humidity but also the psychological discomfort of hearing running water or flushing toilets overhead‚Äîundermining your peace and sleep quality.
          </p>

            4. Do Not Align Bedroom Door Directly with Main Entrance
          </h2>

          <p className="mb-4">
            The main entrance is a high-traffic, active area that introduces strong external energy into the home. If your bedroom door faces the front door, it compromises privacy and invites disruptive energy directly into your resting area.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Such a setup may affect your health, focus, and financial stability, as it violates the Feng Shui principle of energy containment in rest areas.

            5. Avoid Positioning Bedroom Door Facing the Bathroom
          </h2>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Bathrooms generate moisture and negative energy (Sha Qi) due to their function and water usage. A bedroom door facing the bathroom door allows unpleasant smells and humidity to seep into the bedroom, disturbing your rest and potentially harming your health.
          </p>

            6. Do Not Position Bedroom Next to the Kitchen
          </h2>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Kitchens are areas of heat, fire, and intense activity, often filled with cooking fumes and oil. If your bedroom shares a wall with the kitchen‚Äîespecially if your bed backs onto the stove wall‚Äîit can lead to sleep disturbances and unstable emotions.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Moreover, strong yang energy (heat, activity) from the kitchen clashes with the bedroom‚Äôs yin energy (calm, stillness), causing imbalance in your personal energy field.
          </p>

            7. Avoid Placing a Mirror Directly Opposite the Bedroom Door
          </h2>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Mirrors in Feng Shui are double-edged swords. While they can reflect and repel negative energy, placing them opposite the bedroom door reflects incoming energy back into the room, including potentially harmful influences.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            This setup can amplify bad luck, anxiety, or even spiritual disturbances, especially during nighttime when reflections can be startling.

            8. Don‚Äôt Let Mirrors or Glass Doors Face the Bed
          </h2>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Waking up to your own reflection in the dark or semi-dark can be disorienting and unsettling. In Feng Shui, mirrors should never reflect the bed‚Äîthis can cause nightmares, sleep disturbances, or even bring third-party interference into relationships.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Full-length mirrors, mirrored closets, or glass doors should be covered at night or moved to another wall.
          </p>

            9. Don‚Äôt Place Bed or Bedhead Directly in Line with the Door
          </h2>

          <p className="mb-4">
            One of the most well-known Feng Shui taboos is the ‚Äúcoffin position‚Äù‚Äîplacing the bed in direct line with the bedroom door. This exposes your feet or head to external energy, creating vulnerability while you sleep.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            It can lead to a lack of safety, poor health, and even financial instability. Position your bed so the door is visible but not directly in line with your body.

            10. Avoid Bedhead Against a Window
          </h2>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Windows are dynamic openings where Qi enters and leaves. Placing your bedhead against a window can lead to a lack of support and protection while you sleep. You might feel restless or unsafe, especially during storms or strong winds.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            A solid wall behind your bed is always the best choice‚Äîit symbolizes stability and offers energetic backing in both personal and professional life.
          </p>

            11. Ensure Bedhead is Against a Wall
          </h2>

          <p className="mb-4">
            A floating bedhead‚Äîone that doesn‚Äôt touch any wall‚Äîis a Feng Shui red flag. When you sleep, your awareness is diminished, and lacking support at the head can cause unconscious anxiety, lack of security, and mental disarray.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Always position your bed with the headboard flush against a solid wall for energetic grounding and psychological comfort.

            12. Don‚Äôt Sleep Under Exposed Ceiling Beams
          </h2>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Sleeping under a ceiling beam can cause psychological pressure and anxiety, even if you‚Äôre not consciously aware of it. In Feng Shui, beams are believed to create oppressive energy (Sha Qi) directly above the bed, impacting your health and mental state.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            If beams are unavoidable, consider using a canopy bed or installing a false ceiling to reduce the visual impact.
          </p>

            13. Elevate the Bed Off the Floor
          </h2>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Beds should be raised at least 50 centimeters (20 inches) off the ground. This promotes better air circulation and prevents moisture from seeping into the mattress.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Avoid storing clutter or unused items underneath your bed. In Feng Shui, stagnant energy under the bed can interfere with restful sleep and physical health.

            14. Don‚Äôt Keep Too Many Plants in the Bedroom
          </h2>

          <p className="mb-4">
            While indoor plants are excellent for purifying air and enhancing aesthetics, the bedroom is a place of rest and should maintain a yin (quiet) energy.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Too many plants can generate excessive yang or even yin energy, disrupting the balance. Moreover, most plants absorb oxygen and release carbon dioxide at night, reducing air quality while you sleep.

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2 text-default-800">
            Q1: What is the best fengshui bedroom layout?
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The ideal layout includes a rectangular room, a bed with a solid headboard against the wall, doors that are not directly aligned with the bed, and no mirrors facing the bed.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2 text-default-800">
            Q2: Can I place a mirror in the bedroom?
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Yes, but avoid placing it directly across from the bed or the door. Use covered mirrors or place them where they do not reflect your sleeping self.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2 text-default-800">
            Q3: Is it bad Feng Shui to sleep under a window?
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Yes. Windows are energetically unstable. Try repositioning your bed or use heavy curtains to block energy flow.
