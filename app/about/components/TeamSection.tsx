          I used to work as a structural designer in the architecture industry. Over the years, I’ve witnessed the rapid rise—and inevitable slowdown—of China’s real estate market. As the supply of housing grew, so did people’s desire for not just more space, but better, more harmonious spaces.

        <p>
          In conversations with homeowners and clients, one theme kept appearing: <strong>feng shui matters</strong>. People want homes that feel right—homes that bring peace, prosperity, and positive energy. For offices, it’s about attracting wealth and clarity. These desires aren’t just rooted in tradition—they often reflect <strong>real spatial and psychological needs</strong>.

          A good layout can improve air flow, light, and comfort. A bad one—like an L-shaped apartment with poor ventilation or sharp, unused corners—can make a home feel chaotic or cold. I believe <strong>feng shui is a bridge between ancient wisdom and architectural logic</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          But most people don’t have time to study feng shui, and professional consultants are expensive. That’s why I created this tool: an <strong>AI-powered feng shui analyzer</strong> that lets anyone upload a floor plan or layout and get <strong>instant insights</strong> into energy flow, layout flaws, and improvement suggestions.

          Whether you’re buying a new apartment or designing a new home for a client, this tool helps you make informed decisions based on both tradition and practical design.
        </p>

        <p>
          I believe feng shui should be accessible, understandable, and useful for everyone—not just something mysterious or elite.
